The JiraLike application can be run locally for development and testing.

To run the backend locally, the following steps are required.

Clone the backend repository.
Navigate to the JiraLike.Api project directory.
Run the backend using the command: dotnet run.

The backend starts as a .NET Web API application.
SQLite is used as the database and does not require any additional setup.
The database is created and accessed locally by the application.

To run the frontend locally, the following steps are required.

Clone the frontend repository.
Navigate to the Angular project directory.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Start the frontend using the command: ng serve.

The frontend runs locally and communicates with the backend through REST API endpoints.

Both backend and frontend can be run independently during local development.
